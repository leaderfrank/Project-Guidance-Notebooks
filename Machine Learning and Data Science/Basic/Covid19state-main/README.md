streamlit hello

Key Improvements:
Optimized Data Preparation:

Reduced the number of operations by directly renaming and selecting columns in one step.
Removed redundant steps like grouping by Date_YMD since itâ€™s not necessary for training.
Efficient Model Training:

Combined operations and removed unnecessary .reshape(-1,1) calls where possible.
Removed unnecessary np.array wrapping, simplifying code.
Streamlined Output:

Provided direct output of the model's predictions, RMSE, and accuracy score.
Ensured that plotting is done based on the cleaned DataFrame.
Removed Redundant Code:

Eliminated unused code blocks and redundant imports.
This should make your code run faster and be easier to maintain.
